------------------
How to prepare
------------------

- pip
Just run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install the dependencies. Be careful with the Python version and global packages.

- virtualenv
If you're familiar with ``virtualenv``, then you can create the environment by::

    virtualenv demo

and activate the virtual environment::

    source bin/activate

Finally, use ``pip`` to install the requirements::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Of course, ``virtualenvwrapper`` is more pleasant.

- pipenv(highly recommended)
If you can use ``pipenv``, that's perfect.
Use ``pipenv`` to create a working directory::

    pipenv --python 3.6

(Python 3.6 is great)
and run::

    pipenv install

to install all the dependencies for this project
